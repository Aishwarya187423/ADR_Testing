#ADR: Choosing PHP and Laravel for Web Application Development

**Status**
- Accepted

**Context**
- We need to build a scalable web application with a strong backend and a structured development framework. The application requires rapid development, robust security, and a well-maintained ecosystem. We considered multiple options, including Node.js, Python (Django), and Ruby on Rails, but PHP with Laravel stands out due to its ecosystem, community support, and ease of use.

Decision
- We will use PHP as the backend language and Laravel as the primary framework for web application development. Laravel offers built-in features like authentication, routing, ORM (Eloquent), and blade templating, which accelerate development and improve maintainability.

Consequences
- Positive:

*Laravel’s built-in authentication, ORM, and MVC structure speed up development.
Strong community support and extensive documentation.
PHP is widely supported across hosting services.
Laravel’s security features (CSRF protection, SQL injection prevention) improve security.
Seamless integration with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Redis.

 - Negative:

PHP has a reputation for inconsistent legacy code in some projects.
Laravel has a learning curve for beginners.
Performance might not match Node.js for real-time applications.
Requires version management for PHP dependencies to avoid conflicts.
